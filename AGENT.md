# Chargur AI Agent System

## Overview

The Chargur AI Agent is the intelligent core of our UX design and app architecture planning platform. It acts as a conversational AI assistant that guides users through the entire app development process, from initial ideation to final export-ready specifications.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AgentContextProvider** (`src/components/agent/AgentContextProvider.tsx`)
   - Manages global agent state and memory
   - Provides cross-stage intelligence and recommendations
   - Handles persistent learning and context retention

2. **Canvas Integration** (`src/components/layout/Canvas.tsx`)
   - Main interface for user-agent interaction
   - Handles streaming responses and auto-fill confirmations
   - Manages stage progression and completion

3. **Prompt Engineering System** (`src/lib/prompts/stagePrompts.ts`)
   - Stage-specific prompt generation with context awareness
   - Structured response formatting and validation
   - Cross-stage intelligence and recommendation logic

4. **LLM Client** (`src/lib/llm/llmClient.ts`)
   - Multi-provider LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Streaming response support and token management

5. **Edge Function** (`supabase/functions/agent-prompt/index.ts`)
   - Enhanced LLM integration with proper prompt engineering
   - Structured response parsing and validation
   - Advanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

6. **Spatial Canvas** (`src/components/canvas/SpatialCanvas.tsx`)
   - Visual representation of project data
   - Dynamically updates based on agent interactions
   - Shows relationships between different project elements

## Agent Workflow

### 1. User Input Processing
```
User Message → Agent Context → Edge Function → LLM API → Structured Response
```

### 2. Agentic Loop (Per Stage)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B[Gather Context]
    B --> C[Generate AI Response]
    C --> D[Stream to User]
    D --> E[Auto-Fill Suggestions]
    E --> F{User Confirms?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Update Stage Data]
    F -->|No| H[Continue Conversation]
    G --> I[Check Stage Complete]
    I -->|Yes| J[Progress to Next Stage]
    I -->|No| H
    H --> A
    J --> K[Update Memory & Context]
```

### 3. Cross-Stage Intelligence
The agent maintains awareness across all stages:
- **Memory Persistence**: Stores decisions and context from previous stages
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests features/options based on earlier choices
- **Dependency Detection**: Warns about missing requirements or conflicts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Builds upon previous work intelligently

## Robust Prompt Engineering

### Stage-Specific Prompt Architecture
Each stage has carefully crafted prompts that include:

1. **Role Definition**: Clear AI persona and responsibilities
2. **Context Integration**: Full project history and cross-stage data
3. **Response Structure**: Exact JSON format specifications
4. **Auto-Fill Logic**: Intelligent data extraction and suggestion rules
5. **Completion Criteria**: Clear stage completion requirements

### Prompt Engineering Principles

1. **Specificity**: Detailed technical requirements and constraints
2. **Context Awareness**: Integration of all previous stage data
3. **Structured Output**: Consistent JSON response format
4. **Error Resilience**: Fallback responses for parsing failures
5. **Cross-Stage Intelligence**: Smart recommendations based on project evolution

### Example Prompt Structure
```typescript
{
  systemPrompt: `You are an expert UX strategist...
    CORE RESPONSIBILITIES: [detailed list]
    CROSS-STAGE CONTEXT: [previous stage data]
    AUTO-FILL OPPORTUNITIES: [specific extraction rules]
    COMPLETION CRITERIA: [clear requirements]`,
  
  userPrompt: `User message: "${userMessage}"
    Respond in this exact JSON format: {...}`,
  
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 1000
}
```

- **Cross-Stage Validation**: No conflicts with previous stages

### Automatic Progression
When a stage is complete:
1. Mark current stage as completed
2. Unlock next stage (if not coming soon)
3. Automatically navigate to next stage
4. Provide transition context to maintain continuity
5. Update agent memory with completion data
